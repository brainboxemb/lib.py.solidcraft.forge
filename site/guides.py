<h2 id="goal">Start with the thing you want to build</h2>
<p>You do not need to think in SolidCraft commands, transformation matrices or
joint internals to use Forge. Start by asking a simpler question:
<strong>what are the physical parts, and how are they related?</strong></p>
<p>For a small frame with four corner brackets, for example, you might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>two side boards;</li>
<li>a top and bottom board;</li>
<li>one reusable corner-bracket design;</li>
<li>eight placed copies of that bracket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forge turns that description into native SolidCraft geometry and assembly
relationships.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model: one thing you can build</h2>
<p>A <strong>model</strong> is a Python class with a <code>build()</code>
method. It describes one piece of geometry or one composed result.</p>

<p>The public dimensions can become editable CAD parameters. You normally do
not need to write SolidCraft commands yourself.</p>

<h2 id="component">Component: a reusable physical part</h2>
<p>A <strong>component</strong> is a model that represents a reusable part.
Think of a bracket, panel, beam or PCB enclosure. If you need the same part
five times, you still want one definition of the part.</p>
""" + code("""@component
class Bracket:
    def build(self):
        return Box(40, 20, 10)""") + """
<p>Changing the component definition changes what every occurrence of that
part represents.</p>

<p>An <strong>occurrence</strong> is one use of a component inside a larger
design. It has its own position and orientation, while sharing the same
component definition.</p>
""" + code("""first = Bracket()
second = first.copy().move(x=80)""") + """
<p>This is similar to putting two identical purchased brackets on a workbench:
they are two physical instances of the same part design.</p>

construction. An assembly is not one fused blob of geometry. The parts remain
separate, reusable objects with relationships between them.</p>

<p>An assembly can itself expose useful attachment locations for something
that will be mounted to the complete frame.</p>

<h2 id="anchor">Anchor: a meaningful place and direction</h2>
<p>An <strong>anchor</strong> tells Forge where a relationship belongs.
A simple anchor can mean “the right face” or “the front-top-left corner”.
More advanced anchors can also describe orientation.</p>
""" + code("""parent=Anchor.FRONT_TOP_LEFT

change.</p>

as a local attachment reference, not merely a world XYZ point. For oriented
attachments, its local directions matter too.</div>

<h2 id="attachment">Attachment: the relationship between two anchors</h2>
<p><code>attach()</code> says that one component occurrence belongs relative
to another one. You choose a parent anchor and a child anchor; Forge converts
that relationship into the appropriate native SolidCraft representation.</p>

    side,
    parent=Anchor.FRONT_TOP_LEFT,

<p>From a user point of view, the important statement is simply:
“attach this bracket here using this side of the bracket.” You should not need
to design the underlying SolidCraft joint yourself.</p>

<h2 id="relationship-values">Gap, offset and orientation are different ideas</h2>
<p>Once two anchors are related, additional values may refine that
relationship. Keep these concepts separate:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Concept</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>gap</code></td><td>Distance along the attachment normal</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>offset=(u,v)</code></td><td>Displacement inside the local attachment plane</td></tr>
<tr><td>orientation / frame</td><td>Which way the attached part faces</td></tr>
<tr><td>world move</td><td>Explicit placement in assembly X/Y/Z coordinates</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These are intentionally not interchangeable. A local attachment offset is
not automatically a world-X or world-Z movement.</p>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters: dimensions you expect to edit later</h2>
<p>A parameter is a value that should remain meaningful after the Python model
has been compiled. If a frame width changes from 800 to 900 mm, an attached
part should ideally follow its semantic anchor rather than keep an old
hard-coded coordinate.</p>
<p>This is why Forge qualification tests do more than check the initial
picture: important cases also edit the saved SolidCraft parameters and verify
that relationships still solve correctly.</p>

<h2 id="solidcraft">What SolidCraft does underneath</h2>
<p>Forge is a description and compilation layer. SolidCraft remains the CAD
engine. Forge may lower your intent to sketches, extrusions, component
occurrences, joint origins or native joints, but those are implementation
details unless you are debugging or extending Forge.</p>

model writing, keep the simpler hierarchy in mind:</p>

anchor should continue to mean the same corner when a parameter changes the

<p>A reliable attachment needs a local frame. Conceptually that frame contains:</p>

<li>an origin — where the attachment is;</li>
<li>a normal/direction — which way it faces;</li>
<li>a rotation reference around that normal.</li>
